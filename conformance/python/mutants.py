"""Proves the conformance vectors can tell a wrong implementation from a right one.

Each mutant makes one small, plausible mistake in disc_menus.py (a wrong constant, a dropped rule). The vectors must fail for every
one. A mutant that survives means a rule is not pinned down by any vector, so a client could get it wrong and still "pass".
