# Jellyfin 12.x notes

Facts about writing a plugin for **Jellyfin 12** (net10.0), each checked against the real
`Jellyfin.Controller` / `Jellyfin.Model` / `Jellyfin.Common` 12.0.0 packages or a running 12.1 server.
Jellyfin 12 is new: the official docs and the plugin template lagged behind it when this was written
(they still targeted 10.11 / net9.0), and some guesses that looked right turned out wrong. If you
extend the plugin, check a signature against the real assembly before trusting memory or a web search.

A cheap way to check: load the assembly from the NuGet cache with reflection and list the members of a
type, or just build and read the compiler's `CS0234` / `CS0246` error.

## Plugin basics

- `BasePlugin<TConfig>` is in `MediaBrowser.Common.Plugins`; its constructor takes
  `(IApplicationPaths, IXmlSerializer)`. Only `Name` is abstract.
- **Override `Id` and `Description` yourself** (matching `build.yaml`'s guid). `BasePlugin.Id` only
  populates from an assembly-level `[Guid]` attribute (most plugins don't set one), and the plugin
  manager treats the *assembly's* values as authoritative, rewriting `meta.json` to match on every
  startup. An un-overridden `Id` is `Guid.Empty`, which zeroes the manifest and breaks the dashboard
  sidebar entry and the plugin detail page (both are keyed by plugin id).
- `IHasWebPages` is in `MediaBrowser.Model.Plugins`; `IPluginServiceRegistrator` is in
  `MediaBrowser.Controller.Plugins`; `BasePluginConfiguration` is in `MediaBrowser.Model.Plugins`.
- Controllers need no special base class: plain `ControllerBase` + `[ApiController]` is enough, and MVC
  discovers the plugin assembly's controllers on its own (no `FrameworkReference` needed).
- `[Authorize(Policy = "RequiresElevation")]` is a real, registered policy for admin-only endpoints. A bare
  `[Authorize]` means "any signed-in user". `[AllowAnonymous]` is needed for anything a browser fetches
  without Jellyfin's auth header (an `<img>`, a script tag).
- Request bodies that must be accepted as raw text (so half-typed JSON can't trip model binding) are best
  read straight from `Request.Body`.
- API responses are serialised **PascalCase**.
- Plugin install layout: `<config>/data/plugins/<Name>_<version>/` holding the DLL and a `meta.json`.
  `assemblies` in `meta.json` is empty even for working plugins; the folder is scanned. `targetAbi`
  `12.0.0.0` loads fine on 12.1 (it is a minimum, not an exact match).
- Plugin configuration is stored as XML under `<config>/data/plugins/configurations/`; the root element is
  literally `PluginConfiguration` and children are property names.

## Library and items

- `BaseItem.ExtraType` (nullable), `.Path`, `.RunTimeTicks` (nullable), `.ProviderIds`, `.ProductionYear`,
  `.Width`, `.Height`, `.RemoteTrailers` (`IReadOnlyList<MediaUrl>`), `.OwnerId` all exist directly.
- `BaseItem.GetExtras(User)` takes `Jellyfin.Database.Implementations.Entities.User`, **not**
  `Jellyfin.Data.Entities.User` (that type exists too, which makes for a confusing compile error). It needs a
  user; for background work use a query instead:
  `ILibraryManager.GetItemList(new InternalItemsQuery { OwnerIds = [id], IncludeExtras = true })`, then filter
  the result in code (`OwnerId == id`) rather than relying on the query's semantics alone.
- `InternalItemsQuery` has `HasAnyProviderId` / `HasAnyProviderIds` (`Dictionary<string,string>`),
  `IncludeItemTypes` (`BaseItemKind[]`, namespace `Jellyfin.Data.Enums`), `OwnerIds`, `ExtraTypes`,
  `IncludeExtras`, `ParentId`, `Recursive`, `IsVirtualItem`, `Years`. Provider keys are `Tmdb`, `Imdb`, `Tvdb`.
- `ILibraryManager` raises `ItemAdded`, `ItemUpdated` and `ItemRemoved`
  (`EventHandler<ItemChangeEventArgs>`). `ILibraryPostScanTask` exists.
- Chapters: `IChapterManager.GetChapters(Guid itemId)` returns `ChapterInfo`
  (`StartPositionTicks`, `Name`, `ImagePath`, `ImageDateModified`, `ImageTag`). Chapter thumbnails exist only
  if the "Extract chapter images" task has run; the web URL is `/Items/{id}/Images/Chapter/{index}`.
- `ExtraType` (`MediaBrowser.Model.Entities`): `Unknown`, `Clip`, `Trailer`, `BehindTheScenes`,
  `DeletedScene`, `Interview`, `Scene`, `Sample`, `ThemeSong`, `ThemeVideo`, `Featurette`, `Short`. In the
  database it is an integer, in that order starting at 0.
- Item ids appear in both 32-hex ("N") and hyphenated ("D") form; `System.Text.Json`'s built-in `Guid`
  converter only reads the hyphenated form, so accept both with a custom converter built on `Guid.Parse`.
- `ExtraType` and `ImageType` are **not** decorated with a string-enum converter, so using them directly in a
  type deserialised from JSON needs `[JsonConverter(typeof(JsonStringEnumConverter))]` on your property.
- Jellyfin's `GET /Items/{id}/SpecialFeatures` needs a user; with an API key (no user) it throws unless you
  pass `userId`.
- `GET /Items/{id}/RemoteImages?type=Backdrop&providerName=TheMovieDb` lists a title's TMDB images without
  needing a TMDB key.

## Injecting a script into the web client

Jellyfin core has no supported way for a plugin to modify jellyfin-web. The community workaround is the
separate **File Transformation** plugin, which hooks the middleware so other plugins can rewrite served
files (such as `index.html`).

- Register with `PluginInterface.RegisterTransformation(JObject payload)`; the payload has an `id` (a guid),
  `fileNamePattern` (a regex tested against the path relative to `/web/`, so use `^index\.html$`, anchored),
  and one of `transformationEndpoint` (File Transformation POSTs `{"contents": "..."}` and uses the
  response body as the new text), `transformationPipe`, or a reflection callback.
- **Cross-plugin type identity.** Every plugin loads in its own `AssemblyLoadContext`, so the
  `Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject` your code builds is a *different type* from the one File Transformation
  expects, even though the names and versions match; passing it fails with
  `Object of type 'JObject' cannot be converted to type 'JObject'`. Don't reference Newtonsoft yourself: find
  the already-loaded assembly via `AssemblyLoadContext.All` and build the payload from a JSON string through
  its `JObject.Parse`.
- Injecting into `index.html` itself is a normal top-level page load, so a plain `<script src>` anywhere in
  the document runs; the "script must be inside the page element" rule below applies only to dashboard
  pages.

## jellyfin-web (client side)

- **Plugin config pages:** only the `div[data-role="page"]` element is inserted into the live DOM.
  Anything after it (including a trailing `<script>`) never reaches the page and **silently does nothing**.
  Put the script inside the page div. The classic `pageshow` event, `window.ApiClient` and `window.Dashboard`
  are all still available.
- **Dashboard sidebar** entries come from `GET /web/ConfigurationPages?enableInMainMenu=true`; only
  `EnableInMainMenu` and `MenuIcon` matter today.
- **Routing** is hash-based (`#/details?id=<guid>`); `hashchange` fires on in-app navigation.
- **`playbackManager` is not reachable** from an injected script (it is an ES module inside the bundle; there
  is no global and no AMD `require` bridge). One-click playback instead sends `PlayNow` to the browser's own
  session through the Sessions API (`POST /Sessions/{id}/Playing`, with `StartPositionTicks` to start at a
  chapter), finding the session by `ApiClient.deviceId()`.
- **Theming:** Jellyfin 12 exposes very few runtime CSS variables (a handful, and no colour palette), so a
  script can't theme itself from the user's skin; menus bring their own theme.
- `ApiClient.getImageUrl(itemId, { type, index })` appends `/index` whenever `index != null`, including `0`.
- jQuery is available as `window.jQuery`, but nothing here needs it.
- No Content-Security-Policy is sent by default, so third-party embeds (the YouTube trailer iframe) work; a
  reverse proxy in front of Jellyfin may add one.

## Dependency injection

Plugins can take any registered service in a constructor. Resolve optional ones lazily from `IServiceProvider`
and degrade gracefully if absent. An `IHostedService` registered in `RegisterServices` runs like any other.
